// How to Solve :
/*
  When you try to send a value on an unbuffered channel, the send operation will block (pause execution) until a receiver is ready to receive the value.
	â€¢	Similarly, when you try to receive from an unbuffered channel, the receive operation will block until a sender sends a value.

  In other words, both the send and receive must happen at the same time for the communication to succeed.
  Result : we ready receiver another go routine
